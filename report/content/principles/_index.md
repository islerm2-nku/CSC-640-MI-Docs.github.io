# Software Quality Documentation

Quality software is not an accident—it's the result of:
- **Deliberate practices**
- **Careful planning** 
- **Continuous improvement**

This guide covers essential principles that lead to maintainable, reliable, and successful software projects.

## The Core Quality Principles

1. **[Well-Defined Stories & Clear Goals](./requirements)** - Foundation for all quality decisions
2. **[Right Tech Stack Selection](./tech-stack)** - Choosing appropriate technologies
3. **[Modular Code Design](./modular-code)** - Building reusable, maintainable components
4. **[API Design Best Practices](./api-design)** - Creating clear, maintainable APIs
5. **[Design & Diagrams](./design-and-diagrams)** - Visualizing software architecture
6. **[Comprehensive Test Coverage](./testing)** - Ensuring reliability through testing
7. **[Deploy Early & Often](./deployment)** - Continuous integration and deployment
8. **[Additional Quality Practices](./additional-topics)** - Code review, security, monitoring & more

## Getting Started

Choose a principle to focus on first, assess your project's current state, implement incrementally, and measure your progress. Quality is a continuous journey, not a destination.
